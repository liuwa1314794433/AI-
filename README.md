# AI-Theory

## Deep Learning

- Shallow  

- Gaussian mixed model (GMM), max entropy, support vector machine (SVM),
  naive Bayes, kernel methods  


- Deep  

- Supervised: MLP, DCNN  

- Unsupervised/Semi-supervised: Autoencoder, Deep Belief Networks  




## What AI/ML Can Do  

- Learn some hidden patterns  
- If there exists one  
- Given sufficiently many training data.  
- With reasonable prior hypotheses (humanâ€™s best understanding of the problem)  
- With high probability, output an accurate enough hypothesis  
- Automatically construct high-level features from low-level ones  
- Still, with reasonable prior  
- Finding suitable representations  
- Current 3rd-wave techniques usually lack of theoretical supports  

## What AI/ML Can NOT Do  
- Can NOT generate new information out of nothing   
- Can NOT learn useful things without a prior hypothesis (bias)  
- No bias, no learning  
- Can NOT arbitrarily increase SNR (signal to noise ratio)  
- Garbages in, garbages out
